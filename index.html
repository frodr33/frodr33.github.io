				<b>Software Engineering Intern</b>
				<p>Summer 2018</p>
				<p class="text-body">At Moody's Analytics, I was a Software Engineering Intern focusing on fullstack web development and software architecture.
					I worked on the UI of a new credit rating application using Angular, Node, Angular Material, and Apollo. In addition
					to the UI, I also added to the GraphQL API so I could send GraphQL queries from the UI to the API to query json data
					from Moody's databases as deserialized C# objects. The GraphQL backend was built using C# and the ASP.NET framework.
					Additionally, I worked on Moody's backend, implementing Domain Driven Design principles in a Microservices Architecture.
					Using RabbitMQ, I helped update integrate event sourcing and aggregates in the backend.

					and deliver it as a multi-platform application using the Oculus Go, mobile devices, and the web. As CTO, I am desinging
					and deploying a monolith-first architecture with the UI layer containing the VR, mobile, and web applications and interfacing
					it with Amazon Web Services such as S3, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, etc. Currently, I have deployed an early stage web
					application and managed a team to develop the Virtual Reality application during the Summer 2018 using Unity, C#, and
					Photon Networking.

				<b>Data Science Intern</b>
				<p class="margin-none">Summer 2017</p>
				<p class="text-body">At KPMG, I was a Data Science intern working on a team creating a cognitive platform for internal KPMG clients to automate
					the process of analyzing large financial documents with an AI pipeline. I helped build the input data to train the pipeline,
					then verified the results using the SPARQL query language while attempting to make connections about the data. Additionally,
					I worked with python to automate the organization of large amounts of similarly named files in a folder structure. This
					internship was my first expereince in corporate culture, so I also experienced agile team management methods and overall
					let me learn about team management.

				<p class="margin-none">https://github.com/frodr33/fire-emblem</p>
				<p class="text-body">During second semester sophomore year, me and three other students teamed up and created a Fire Emblem clone completely
					in Ocaml. Each of the members in the group worked over 80+ hours on the project. I set up the project, installing necessary
					dependencies and worked on the UI of the application. I used JS_Of_Ocaml, an Ocaml to Javascript translator and was
					able to display sprites, show movement, built maps, and any other visual effects. I implemented a 'clock' to control
					the animations to ensure that all sprites move synchronously.

					a study about the effects of flight simulation on mental health, I created the physics to fly in game using Unity and
					C#. The project was presented at Stanford University. Additinally, I worked on networking two computers over a network
					together with motion tracking and voice recording.

					number of people in a bus so that the users could see if the bus was full before getting to the bus stop and not being
					able to enter. We used an infrared sensors and an Arduino Uno with C, and sent the data to the application which would
					count the number of people that crossed through the IR sensor and display it.
